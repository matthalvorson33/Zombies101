As a college student, I want to play a game relevant to my current experiences, so that I can better relate to the gameplay.
As a player, I want to fight at least 6 different types of enemies, so that I don't get bored.
As a high school student, I want to play a game about college, so that I can virtually live out dreams for my near future.
