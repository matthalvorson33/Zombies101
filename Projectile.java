   //TODO find box class to add to use for collisions. Will look at kid's projects from last summer to find them.
    //use rectangle class. I added a getRectangle to the interface for movable that will return a hitbox. Need to add logic to AcitonPerformed in the main class to user rectnagle.isTouching() or somethig to see and react to collisions
